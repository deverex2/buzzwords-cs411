I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life    Let him know that you know best 'Cause after all  you do know best Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence Lay down a list of what is wrong The things you've told him all along And pray to God He hears you And pray to God He hears you  and    Where did I go wrong?

1239,"  Yeah  it's my life In my own words  I guess    Have you ever loved someone so much  you'd give an arm for? Not the expression  no  literally give an arm for When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you? And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you? What happens when you become the main source of her pain? ""Daddy  look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane"" ""Daddy  where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy  where is she?"" ""I don't know  go play  Hailie  baby  your daddy's busy Daddy's writin' a song  this song ain't gon' write itself I'll give you one underdog  then you gotta swing by yourself"" Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady  yeah  baby  Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me  but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby    And when I'm gone  just carry on  don't mourn  rejoice Every time you hear the sound of my voice  just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thang So  baby  don't feel no pain  just smile back And when I'm gone  just carry on  don't mourn  rejoice Every time you hear the sound of my voice  just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thang So  baby  don't feel no pain  just smile back    I keep havin' this dream  I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing ""You're makin' Mommy cry  why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"" ""Baby  Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy  you're lyin'! You always say that  you always say this is the last time But you ain't leavin' no more  Daddy  you're mine!"" She's pilin' boxes in front of the door  tryna block it ""Daddy  please! Daddy  don't leave! Daddy  no  stop it!"" Goes in her pocket  pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture  ""This'll keep you safe  Daddy  take it with ya!"" I look up  it's just me standin' in the mirror These fuckin' walls must be talkin'  'cause man  I can hear 'em They're sayin'  ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!"" And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It turns to a stage  they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'    And when I'm gone  just carry on  don't mourn  rejoice Every time you hear the sound of my voice  just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thang So  baby  don't feel no pain  just smile back And when I'm gone  just carry on  don't mourn  rejoice Every time you hear the sound of my voice  just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thang So  baby  don't feel no pain  just smile back    Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat The curtain closes  they're throwin' roses at my feet I take a bow  and thank you all for comin' out They're screamin' so loud  I take one last look at the crowd I glance down  I don't believe what I'm seein' ""Daddy  it's me! Help Mommy  her wrists are bleedin'!"" But baby  we're in Sweden  how did you get to Sweden? ""I followed you  Daddy  you told me that you weren't leavin' You lied to me  Dad  and now you made Mommy sad And I bought you this coin  it says 'Number One Dad' That's all I wanted  I just wanted to give you this coin I get the point  fine  me and Mommy are goin'."" But baby  wait! – ""It's too late  Dad  you made the choice Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us That's what they want  they want you  Marshall  they keep Screamin' your name  it's no wonder you can't go to sleep Just take another pill  yeah  I bet you you will You rap about it  yeah  word  k-keep it real."" I hear applause  all this time I couldn't see How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me? I turn around  find a gun on the ground  cock it Put it to my brain  scream  ""Die  Shady!"" and pop it The sky darkens  my life flashes  the plane that I was Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes That's when I wake up  alarm clock's ringin'  there's birds singin' It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin' I walk right up to Kim and kiss her  tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles  and winks at her little sister  almost as if to say    And when I'm gone  just carry on  don't mourn  rejoice Every time you hear the sound of my voice  just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thang So  baby  don't feel no pain  just smile back And when I'm gone  just carry on  don't mourn  rejoice Every time you hear the sound of my voice  just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thang So  baby  don't feel no pain  just smile back  *Curtains closing*",https://genius.com/Eminem-when-im-gone-lyrics,2005-12-06,Eminem,90,45,When I'm Gone

154911,  Closed off from love  I didn't need the pain Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain Time starts to pass  before you know it you're frozen But something happened for the very first time with you My heart melted to the ground Found something true And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy    But I don't care what they say  I'm in love with you They try to pull me away  but they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I    Keep bleeding Keep  keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep  keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep  keep bleeding love You cut me open    Trying hard not to hear  but they talk so loud Their piercing sounds fill my ears  try to fill me with doubt Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling But nothing's greater than the risk That comes with your embrace And in this world of loneliness  I see your face Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy Maybe  maybe    But I don't care what they say  I'm in love with you They try to pull me away  but they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I    Keep bleeding Keep  keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep  keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep  keep bleeding love You cut me open    And it's draining all of me Though they find it hard to believe I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see    But I don't care what they say  I'm in love with you They try to pull me away  but they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I    Keep bleeding Keep  keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep  keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep  keep bleeding love (Ooh  you cut me open and I) Keep bleeding Keep  keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep  keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep  keep bleeding love    Ooh  you cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep  keep bleeding love,https://genius.com/Leona-lewis-bleeding-love-lyrics,2007-10-19,Leona Lewis,2,12321,Bleeding Love

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror  my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror  my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world,https://genius.com/Coldplay-viva-la-vida-lyrics,2008-05-25,Coldplay,55,8351,Viva la Vida

376636,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart  we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives  in addition to observances of all of life's nuances  rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty  traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart  in 1989  dedicated to the then-rising genre  birthed out of hip-hop. At the time  MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old  and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved  there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart  we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

And you look for a place to hide? Did someone break your heart inside? You're in ruins    One  twenty-one guns Lay down your arms Give up the fight One  twenty-one guns Throw up your arms into the sky You and I    When you're at the end of the road And you lost all sense of control And your thoughts have taken their toll When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul Your faith walks on broken glass And the hangover doesn't pass Nothing's ever built to last You're in ruins    One  twenty-one guns Lay down your arms Give up the fight One  twenty-one guns Throw up your arms into the sky You and I    Did you try to live on your own When you burned down the house and home? Did you stand too close to the fire? Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone       When it's time to live and let die And you can't get another try Something inside this heart has died You're in ruins    One  twenty-one guns Lay down your arms Give up the fight One  twenty-one guns Throw up your arms into the sky One  twenty-one guns Lay down your arms Give up the fight One  twenty-one guns Throw up your arms into the sky You and I,https://genius.com/Green-day-21-guns-lyrics,2009-05-25,Green Day,78,632,21 Guns

I could really use a wish right now  wish right now  wish right now    Yeah I could use a dream or a genie or a wish To go back to a place much simpler than this 'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin' And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion And all the pandemonium and all the madness There comes a time where you fade to the blackness And when you starin' at that phone in your lap And you hopin'  but them people never call you back But that's just how the story unfolds You get another hand soon after you fold And when your plans unravel in the sand What would you wish for if you had one chance? So airplane  airplane  sorry I'm late I'm on my way  so don't close that gate If I don't make that  then I'll switch my flight And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night    Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?

I could really use a wish right now  wish right now  wish right now    Yeah  yeah Somebody take me back to the days Before this was a job  before I got paid Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank Yeah  back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes Then maybe  oh maybe  I'll go back to the days Before the politics that we call the rap game And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape And back before I tried to cover up my slang But this is for Decatur—what's up  Bobby Ray? So can I get a wish to end the politics And get back to the music that started this shit? So here I stand and then again I say I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes    Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars? I could really use a wish right now  wish right now  wish right now Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?

Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you”  ""No  you ain't  come back!"" We're runnin' right back  here we go again It's so insane  'cause when it's goin' good  it's goin' great I'm Superman with the wind at his back  she's Lois Lane But when it's bad  it's awful  I feel so ashamed I snap  ""Who's that dude?""

You meet  and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feelin'  yeah  them chills  used to get 'em Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em? You swore you'd never hit 'em  never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em You push  pull each other's hair  scratch  claw  bit 'em Throw 'em down  pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that's the culprit   it controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'Cause today  that was yesterday  yesterday is over It's a different day  sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her  next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance  life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane    Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

Well  that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie    Now  I know we said things  did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns  same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me when it comes to love You're just as blinded  baby  please Come back  it wasn't you  baby  it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside  pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault  look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed  I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize  even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games  I just want her back I know I'm a liar  if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  I'm just gonna    Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

376636,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart  we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives  in addition to observances of all of life's nuances  rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty  traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart  in 1989  dedicated to the then-rising genre  birthed out of hip-hop. At the time  MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old  and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved  there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart  we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore  we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100. ""All of the Lights"" - Kanye West 99. ""No Lie"" - 2 Chainz feat. Drake 98.

(Please take me away from here) When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (haha)    To ten million fireflies I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes I got misty eyes as they said farewell (said farewell) But I'll know where several are If my dreams get real bizarre 'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar  jar  jar)    I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep) I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep) I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep Because my dreams are bursting at the seams,https://genius.com/Owl-city-fireflies-lyrics,2009-07-14,Owl City,30,13286,Fireflies

2520,"  You were in college  working part-time  waiting tables Left a small town and never looked back I was a flight risk  with a fear of falling Wondering why we bother with love  if it never lasts    I say  ""Can you believe it?"" As we're lying on the couch The moment  I could see it Yes  yes  I can see it now    Do you remember  we were sitting there  by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine    Flash forward  and we're taking on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes    But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes  yes This is what I thought about:    Do you remember  we were sitting there  by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine    And I remember that fight  2:30 AM As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out  crying  and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye 'Cause that's all I've ever known Then  you took me by surprise You said  ""I'll never leave you alone.""    You said  ""I remember how we felt  sitting by the water And every time I look at you  it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine"" Hold on  make it last Hold on  never turn back You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine    Yeah  yeah Do you believe it?

Can you see me? Get your Visine on Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on If you thinking I'ma quit before I die  dream on Man they treat me like a legend  am I really this cold? I'm really too young to be feeling this old It's about time you admit it  who you kidding?

Mate  now my hunger would leave them amazed  great It feels like a long time coming  fam Since the day I thought of that cunning plan One day I had a dream  I tried to chase it But I wasn’t going nowhere  running man I knew that maybe someday I would understand Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand Everyone's a kid that no one cares about You just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out    Oh  written in the stars A million miles away  a message to the main  oh Seasons come and go  but I will never change And I’m on my way    Oh  oh  oh  oh (oh) Oh  oh  oh  oh  (oh) Oh  oh  oh  oh  (oh) Oh  oh  oh  oh  (oh) Oh  oh  oh  oh (iSHI) Oh  oh  oh  oh  (Eric Turner) Oh  oh  oh  oh  (Let's go)    Oh  seasons come and go  but I will never change And I’m on my way,https://genius.com/Tinie-tempah-written-in-the-stars-lyrics,2010-09-19,Tinie Tempah,62,721,Written in the Stars

65848,  Now and then I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy you could die Told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love and it's an ache I still remember You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end  always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well  you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad it was over    But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough No  you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know    Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believing it was always something that I'd done But I don't wanna live that way Reading into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know    But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough No  you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know    Somebody (I used to know) Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know) Somebody (I used to know) Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know) (I used to know) (That I used to know) (I used to know) Somebody,https://genius.com/Gotye-somebody-that-i-used-to-know-lyrics,2011-07-05,Gotye,1,17395,Somebody That I Used To Know

Yeah  I  I know it's hard to remember The people we used to be It's even harder to picture That you're not here next to me You say it's too late to make it But is it too late to try? And in our time that you wasted All of our bridges burned down    I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time when we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise    I'm at a payphone  trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby  it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two?

Baby  it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two?

Baby  it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two?

376636,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart  we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives  in addition to observances of all of life's nuances  rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty  traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart  in 1989  dedicated to the then-rising genre  birthed out of hip-hop. At the time  MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old  and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved  there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart  we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

376636,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart  we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives  in addition to observances of all of life's nuances  rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty  traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart  in 1989  dedicated to the then-rising genre  birthed out of hip-hop. At the time  MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old  and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved  there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart  we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer You hear sometimes late at night On your radio  Even though you're a million miles away When you hear Born in the USA You relive those glory days So long ago  When you think about me  do you think about 17 Do you think about my old jeep Think about the stars in the sky Funny how a melody sounds like a memory Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night Springsteen Springsteen  Woah-oh-oh-oh  Funny how a melody sounds like a memory Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night Springsteen Springsteen Woah Springsteen  Woah-oh-oh-oh",https://genius.com/Eric-church-springsteen-lyrics,2012-02-21,Eric Church,58,32085,Springsteen

They've never drove through Indiana Met the men who plowed that earth Planted that seed  busted his ass for you and me Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas They'd understand why God made Those flyover states    I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul Roads and rails under their feet Yeah that sounds like a first class seat    On the plains of Oklahoma With a windshield sunset in your eyes Like a water-colored painted sky  You'll think heaven's doors have opened You'll understand why God made Those flyover states    Take a ride across the badlands Feel that freedom on your face Breathe in all that open space And meet a girl from Amarillo You'll understand why God made You might even wanna plant your stakes In those flyover states (Yeah)    Have you ever been through Indiana?

81672,"     When I was in the third grade  I thought that I was gay ‘Cause I could draw  my uncle was  and I kept my room straight I told my mom  tears rushing down my face She's like  ""Ben  you've loved girls since before Pre-K!"" Trippin'  yeah I guess she had a point  didn't she? A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math like  ""Yeah  I'm good at little league."" A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant For those that like the same sex had the characteristics The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man-made  rewiring of a pre-disposition Playing God  aw nah  here we go America the brave still fears what we don't know And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago I don't know    And I can't change  even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can't change  even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love  my love  my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm    If I was gay  I would think hip-hop hates me Have you read the YouTube comments lately? ""Man  that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily We've become so numb to what we're sayin' Our culture founded from oppression Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board A word rooted in hate  yet our genre still ignores it ""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion Gender to skin color  the complexion of your pigment The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins It's human rights for everybody  there is no difference Live on and be yourself When I was at church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service  those words aren't anointed That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same  but that's not important No freedom 'til we're equal  damn right I support it       And I can't change  even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love  my love  my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm    We press play  don't press pause: progress  march on! With a veil over our eyes  we turn our back on the cause 'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law Kids are walking 'round the hallway Plagued by a pain in their heart A world so hateful  some would rather die than be who they are And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all But it's a damn good place to start No law's gonna change us  we have to change us Whatever god you believe in  we come from the same one Strip away the fear  underneath it's all the same love About time that we raised up!

What do I stand for? Most nights  I don't know anymore    This is it  boys  this is war What are we waiting for? Why don't we break the rules already? I was never one to believe the hype Save that for the black and white Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked But here they come again to jack my style And that's alright  I found a martyr in my bed tonight She stops my bones from wondering Just who I  who  I  who I am Oh  who am I?

My heart is breaking for my sister And the con that she called ""love"" And then I look into my nephew's eyes Man  you wouldn't believe the most amazing things That can come from some terrible nights    The other night  you wouldn't believe The dream I just had about you and me I called you up  but we'd both agree It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance  oh For the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance  oh",https://genius.com/Fun-some-nights-lyrics,2012-02-21,Fun.,58,16671,Some Nights

Let it go  let it go I'm one with the wind and sky Let it go  let it go You'll never see me cry Here I stand  and here I'll stay Let the storm rage on!

403031,"  I met this girl late last year She said ""don't you worry if I disappear"" I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later  returned I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn But I gave her my time for two or three nights Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again She told me  ""I was never looking for a friend Maybe you could swing by my room around ten Baby  bring the lemon and a bottle of gin We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"" Baby  if you wanted me then should have just said  she's singing    Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe    And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza Before a text message was the only way to reach her Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha  all over the track like a feature And never wants to sleep  I guess that I don't want to either But me and her  we make money the same way Four cities  two planes  the same day And those shows have never been what it's about But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down  the way that things played out When she was kissing him  how I was confused about Now she should figure it out  while I'm sat here singing    Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe    (Knock knock knock) on my hotel door I don't even know if she knows what for She was crying on my shoulder  I already told ya Trust and respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next (you bastard) But you didn't need to take him to bed  that's all And I never saw him as a threat (you bastard) Until you disappeared with him to have sex  of course It's not like we were both on tour We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment But it was never just fun  and I thought you were different This is not the way you realised what you wanted It's a bit too much  too late if I'm honest And all this time  God knows I'm singing    Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe  Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe",https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-dont-lyrics,2014-06-23,Ed Sheeran,52,12418,Don't

460168,  I drove by all the places We used to hang out getting wasted I thought about our last kiss  how it felt  the way you tasted And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine Are you somewhere feeling lonely Even though he’s right beside you When he says those words that hurt you Do you read the ones I wrote you?    Sometimes I start to wonder  was it just a lie? If what we had was real  how could you be fine? 'Cause I'm not fine at all    I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the make-up running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them Like every single wish  we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape 'Cause I'm not fine at all    The pictures that you sent me They're still living in my phone I admit I like to see them  I'll admit I feel alone And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around It hurts to know you’re happy Yeah  it hurts that you moved on It’s hard to hear your name When I haven't seen you in so long    It’s like we never happened  was it just a lie? If what we had was real  how could you be fine? 'Cause I'm not fine at all    I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the make-up running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them Like every single wish  we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape    If today I woke up with you right beside me Like all of this was just some twisted dream I'd hold you closer than I ever did before And you'd never slip away And you'd never hear me say    I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the make-up running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them Like every single wish  we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape    'Cause I'm not fine at all No  I'm really not fine at all Tell me this is just a dream 'Cause I'm really not fine at all,https://genius.com/5-seconds-of-summer-amnesia-lyrics,2014-07-15,5 Seconds of Summer,86,64610,Amnesia

697785,"  There was a time when I was alone Nowhere to go and no place to call home My only friend was the man in the Moon And even sometimes he would go away too Then one night  as I closed my eyes I saw a shadow flying high He came to me with the sweetest smile Told me he wanted to talk for a while He said  ""Peter Pan that's what they call me I promise that you'll never be lonely"" And ever since that day...

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland Usually hanging out with Peter Pan and And when we're bored we play in the woods Always on the run from Captain Hook ""Run  run Lost Boy "" they say to me Away from all of reality Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me And Lost Boys like me are free Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me And Lost Boys like me are free    Peter Pan  Tinker Bell  Wendy Darling Even Captain Hook  you are my perfect storybook Neverland  I love you so  you are now my home sweet home Forever a Lost Boy at last Peter Pan  Tinker Bell  Wendy Darling Even Captain Hook  you are my perfect storybook Neverland  I love you so  you are now my home sweet home Forever a Lost Boy at last And for always I will say...

3266991,CABELLO KICKED OFF HER SOLO CAREER AND HER BAND SISTERS IN FIFTH HARMONY UNEXPECTEDLY DENOUNCED HER FOR IT. NOW SHE’S GOT A TOP FIVE SINGLE  A MUCH-ANTICIPATED ALBUM COMING AND ZERO SECOND THOUGHTS: “YOU HAVE TO HONOR THAT INNER VOICE”.  CAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen  rock-star  hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old  mixed-up-the-address late. She’s running through the dining room of Versailles  a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley  lush black hair streaming  apologies pouring forth  having just rushed from the other Versailles  in the city’s center.  As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning  flashing that disarmingly broad smile  the singer — who was born in Cuba  resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town — says  “I’ve got you on what we’re going to eat.” She then proceeds to order  in rapid-fire Spanish  a bounty of food: lemonades  steaks  rice  beans  plantains  croquettes  flan.  Confusion  stress  the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello’s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony  the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child  with more than 7 million digital songs sold  according to Nielsen Music.  Before the year was out  she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely  that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).  But that’s the confusion and stress. During that same time  Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer  who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time  released the darkly sexy rap-romp single “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly last October  and it climbed the charts. (It’s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that’s not even her first hit: “I Know What You Did Last Summer ” her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes  peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.  She has social numbers to rival the band’s (3.4 million to 5H’s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram)  a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems  in retrospect  like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.  “It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world ” says her friend Mendes  adding  “She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.”  But Cabello  whose album is due this fall  already had fame  fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift  after five years of nonstop touring  recording and meet-and-greets with 5H  is the taste of freedom.  “You know that quote  ‘In the silence  you find God?’ ” asks Cabello  who — in her lace choker  a holey white tee and a black marching band coat — looks like the petite (she’s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. “I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.”  The heart  of course  can be an unreliable guide  and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans — who easily overrun fan polls  like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards’ 2016 Song of the Summer contest  in which “Work From Home” crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake — are not to be underestimated.)  Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career  and she’s not an ordinary human: She’s Beyoncé.  The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to  as it seems all young female pop stars must  thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle.  Zayn Malik disavowed his past  graffitied his home  cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album  all of which only made him cooler.  Niall Horan took a backpacking trip  rediscovered the ’70s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour  which just made him dreamier.  Harry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note.  Cabello  lest she be judged  must be seductive but pure of heart  strong but vulnerable  self-possessed but not selfish. In a way  girl-group rules still apply.  But that hasn’t stopped her from building on her momentum  and not just by hitting the studio and bringing “Bad Things” to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance  a month after Fifth Harmony’s final televised performance).  She has also carefully cultivated her public voice  telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I’m going to stick up for immigrants  and I’m going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.”  After Trump issued his immigration order  she tweeted  “the #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.”  “The easiest route would be to shut my mouth  sing the songs  wear the clothes and keep going  you know?” says Cabello with a jittery laugh  weighing life in 5H against going it alone.  “I mean    at the peak of our career. It’s definitely not the safe option.” But  she says  “I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me  it has always been: Don’t settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.” She flings her arms like she’s on a roller coaster. “I feel alive!”  The lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmony’s songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group  Cabello was doing the most outside it  too. She started writing on her own early in 5H’s career  despite the grueling schedule.  Her friend Taylor Swift’s Red inspired her to make “sonic photographs” of her changing life  so when she wasn’t cutting parts for 5H’s 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywood’s Record Plant  she would be in the studio’s gym  writing lyrics over other artists’ melodies about things like “my first kiss and my first boyfriend.” Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard  and began churning out “shitty demos” while touring malls and  in time  arenas.  “I would wake up super early ” says Cabello  “get off the bus  go to the hotel  put the TV on super loud — I didn’t want people to hear me f—ing yelling — then go into the bathroom  put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.”  So she was basically singing into the toilet?  “Yep.”  “She has done her 10 000 hours ” says Cabello’s manager Roger Gold  co-founder of 300 Entertainment. “Fifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.”  But when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo  bitter  previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way.  When I ask her about it  Cabello doesn’t shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016  although she clearly means to take the high road:  *When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?*  I don’t know. I was always super open   I couldn’t just sing other people’s words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.  *Do you feel like that changed the relationship  your asserting that?*  I think that in a group there is always going to be tension  whether it’s because of this thing or   thing. Obviously  I think that rocked the boat.  *Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?*  No.  *Have you reached out directly?* I did  yeah. I don’t want to get into the details of that  because it was really intense and it’s hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.  *When I first heard you were going solo  I was like  “I’m sure there are no hard feelings because this isn’t a surprise.” Then I was like  “What’s happening?”*  I had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.  Cabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas  after her mother  Sinuhe  insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad  Alejandro  and 9-year-old sister  Sofia) for three weeks in Cancún.  “The first four days were trippy ” says Cabello. “I was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes you’re afraid of the quiet. Like  go  go  go!”  Cabello was raised in Havana and  later  Mexico City. When she was 6  her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead  Camila and Sinu (as she’s called) emigrated legally from Mexico  spent a day in holding  took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend.  Alejandro was forced to stay behind  but after a year-and-a-half of heartache  he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls  stocking shoes. Alejandro  when he arrived  washed cars at the mall. Today  they have a successful contracting company.  “My parents worked really hard ” says Cabello. “We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money  losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat  a roof over our heads and I was going to school  that was enough.”  (Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016  and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.)  Cabello’s Florida friends  who all predate her appearance on The X Factor  reconnected for “Friendsgiving” in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing.  She’s not much for going out: “I had a phase in Miami where I was like  ‘I’m going to do all the things I would do if I were 19 ’ ” which she is. “I went    and I was like  ‘I don’t love this.’ ”  After our brunch in Los Angeles  she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some “chill stuff.”  Mainly  Cabello’s focused on making music.  Even her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey  by young feminist Rupi Kaur  made her cry)  novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez)  movies (her favorites include The Notebook  Titanic  Romeo + Juliet and  above all  the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr.  She also enjoys practicing guitar — 5H player and “super close friend” Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the group’s 7/27 Tour in 2016.  Romantically speaking  says Cabello  “I don’t have anything going on right now ” although she does let slip that “literally every boy I’ve liked has been a Scorpio.” (Rumormongers  take note: Mendes is a Leo.)  And when we start talking about La La Land  she winds up telling an unbelievable story:  “I love the movie because I’m such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like  yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like  ‘I just came out of a relationship.’ He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like  ‘You know what? I’ll get his number.’ He never texted me back.” What? “I don’t know. Maybe it didn’t go through.”  A few weeks after our brunch  in early February  Cabello’s in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles  laptop out and Notes app open  singing from a file called “It’s Only Natural” using her achiest coo and a slight patois: “It’s only natural  I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/It’s only human to  wanna do da tings we do.” The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack Ü-style edited vocal samples.  “I never underestimated her talent  but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision ” says Andrew “Pop” Wansel  who’s known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara  from the control room.  “It’s a real collaboration ” chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes  who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. “Sometimes it’s like a band just jamming.”  The trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabello’s love for Rihanna’s ANTI (“I can loop it forever ” she says)  the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys’ 2007 song “No One ” all things Shakira and  of course  Cuban music.  They want to open the LP with a dusty  piano-clanging cut called “Havana” and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in “One Dance.”  “Camila is an incredible songwriter ” says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio “L.A.” Reid  who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. “She is working overtime.”  Cabello’s mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isn’t a momager so much as her daughter’s right hand and confidante.  Along with the other members of 5H  she has been by Cabello’s side the entire time  and now she’s the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony  meanwhile  is soldiering on without Cabello.  Epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017  too  and 5H’s People’s Choice Awards performance of “Work From Home” in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush  as Fifth Harmony changed the “I” to “We” in Cabello’s opening line  “I ain’t worried about nothing ” and punctuated it with a full stop.  “I know people will try and turn this into  ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ If I’m growing as an artist  that’s success.”  In April 2016  I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story  and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the group’s toll on their private lives. The only one who didn’t cry was Cabello.  “I was like  ‘Oh  my God  this is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.’ I’m sorry about that ” she tells me this time around.  Cabello wasn’t immune to the pressures  just on the mend  fighting anxiety with journaling  exercise  meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then — that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her.  “It’s so hard to hear that ” says Cabello  lowering her head. “It breaks my heart. It’s like I’m watching myself from another person’s perspective  like  ‘Damn  poor girl.’ ”  She did finally cry after the turmoil with the group  in Miami with her parents and sister. And then  she says  “I went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music. It reminds me of where I come from and that this   doesn’t have to be World War III. In Cuba  people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks  throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity. That’s real shit. Not this.  “I know people will try and turn this into  ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ ” continues Cabello. “To me  if I’m in the studio every day and I’m growing as an artist and I’m speaking from my heart  that’s success. The results don’t matter. I mean  isn’t that the goal?”  If Cabello is anxious now  it doesn’t show. She seems proud of what 5H was — “We represented all different kinds of women coming together ” she says fondly — but is candid about what it wasn’t:  “We didn’t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else’s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us  and I don’t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound — we didn’t make it.”,https://genius.com/Billboard-camila-cabello-talks-solo-music-life-after-fifth-harmony-annotated,2017-02-25,Billboard,41,34510,"Camila Cabello Talks Solo Music, Life After Fifth Harmony"

3075800,  I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand But you brought me here  and I'm happy that you did 'Cause now I'm as free  as birds catchin' the wind I always thought I would sink  so I never swam I never went boatin'  don't get how they are floatin' And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand    But here I am  next to you The sky's more blue in Malibu Next to you in Malibu Next to you    We watched the sun go down as we were walkin' I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin' You would explain the current  as I just smile Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change And it'll be us  just for a while Do they even exist? That's when I make a wish  to swim away with the fish Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me I'd be here writing this song    But here I am  next to you The sky's so blue in Malibu Next to you in Malibu Next to you Next to you The sky's so blue in Malibu Next to you    We are just like the waves that flow back and forth Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning And you're there to save me And I wanna thank you with all of my heart It's a brand new start A dream come true in Malibu,https://genius.com/Miley-cyrus-malibu-lyrics,2017-05-11,Miley Cyrus,89,805,Malibu
